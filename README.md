# Product Differentiation in the Automobiles Market: An Empirical Analysis

This notebook provides a replicate of my work as a research assistant at Trinity College. I'll leave out the data cleansing part which I did for a first couple of months and only focus on the modelling here. 
You can check the data cleansing and EDA in the notebooks mentioned above

Paper: *Product Differentiation in the Automobiles Market: An Empirical Analysis* (Rasha Ahmed and Mark Stater) <br>
Research Assistant: My Phung

Summary of findings:

1. **Results:** Final R_squared: **0.7984** | Final MSE: **0.0024**
2. The signs of the coefficients allign with our research, such as follows:
 - The bigger the weight is, the less energy efficient the car would be
 - All else equal, having the label 'Lux' could imply that the car is more energy efficient than average. THis means that luxury cars are produced to overperform non-luxury ones.
3. The model can be improved by solving multicollinearity or adding more meaningful features.*
